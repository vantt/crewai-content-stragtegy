# Level 1: Business Strategy - AI-Human Conversation Framework

## Conversation Flow Structure

### Opening Query
```
AI: 
"
Let's develop your business strategy for content marketing. 
We'll focus on three key areas: target audience, value proposition, and brand vision. 

Shall we start with understanding your target audience?"
```

## A. Target Audience Discovery

### Primary Questions
1. "Who are the main customers or users you're trying to reach?"
2. "What specific problems or challenges do they face in their daily work/life?"
3. "What are their goals and aspirations?"

### Follow-up Questions
```
Based on {initial_response}, AI should probe:
- Demographics: "Could you specify the typical age range, location, and professional background of this audience?"
- Behavior: "Where does this audience typically look for information?"
- Decision factors: "What typically influences their purchasing decisions?"
```

### Data Capture Template
```json
{
    "target_audience": {
        "segments": [{
            "name": "",

            }
        }]
    }
}
```

## B. Value Proposition Exploration

### Primary Questions
1. "How does your product/service solve the challenges we identified?"
2. "What unique benefits do you offer compared to alternatives?"
3. "What measurable outcomes can customers expect?"

### Follow-up Questions
```
Based on {solution_description}, AI should explore:
- Uniqueness: "What makes this approach different from existing solutions?"
- Evidence: "Do you have any specific examples or case studies?"
- Benefits: "Can you rank the top 3 benefits in order of importance to customers?"
```

### Data Capture Template

    "value_proposition": {
        "core_solution": "",

### Primary Questions

2. "What core values drive your business decisions?"
3. "How do you want to be perceived by your target audience?"

### Follow-up Questions
```
Based on {vision_statement}, AI should investigate:
- Timeline: "Where do you see your brand in 5 years?"
- Values: "How do these values manifest in your day-to-day operations?"
- Differentiation: "What aspects of your vision set you apart?"
```

### Data Capture Template
