## Dependencies

- Phase 1 must be completed before Phase 2
- Core Classes (Phase 2) must be completed before Testing (Phase 3)
- Testing must be substantially complete before UI Integration (Phase 4)
- Event System must be completed before State Management
- Base Models must be completed before Core Classes
- DebateProtocol must be completed before WorkflowManager

## Success Criteria

1. Core Protocol
- All events are properly emitted and handled
- State transitions are atomic and consistent
- Models validate correctly
- Recovery mechanisms work as expected

2. Workflow Management
- Tasks execute in correct order
- Dependencies are properly managed
- Resources are allocated efficiently
- State is maintained consistently

3. Testing
- All unit tests pass
- Integration tests show correct behavior
- Performance meets requirements
- Recovery mechanisms work under load

4. UI Integration
- Updates are real-time and accurate
- State is visualized correctly
- Controls work as expected
- System monitoring is accurate

## Next Steps

1. Begin with Phase 1.1 (Event System)
   - Start with EventType and Event model
   - Then implement EventEmitter
   - Finally add persistence

2. Would you like to proceed with implementing the Event System?
